# Wishlist for a Couple

A one-page wishlist meant for couples, with separate sections for each person (we're one, but we're not the same, eh?) Made originally for me and my wife to use before our joint birthday party, but can be used for any occasion.

## Features

* configurable - title, names, introduction, wishlist items with photos, characteristics and links to shops or more details
* space for a large header image - usually the couple's photo; use 1500x500px for size
* wishlist items can be claimed, thus disappearing from the list

## Requirements

* PHP (any version 5+)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) to compile the SCSS files
* modern browsers - uses HTML5 and CSS3 extensively, latest Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer 10+ should be fine

## Installation

1. copy the `data\config.inc.php.dist` to `data\config.inc.php` and fill in all the values to your liking
2. save header image as `data\header.jpg`
3. compile SCSS files with SASS
4. upload to web server
